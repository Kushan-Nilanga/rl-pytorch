# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is subfield of machine learning that is focused on behaviour of an agent in an environment when it is interacted with it. Being fairly new field, RL has shown some of very important breakthroughs in machine learning domain. Reinforcement Learning builds up on a very simple concept and expand across it. 

## Concept Behind Reinforcement Learning
Intuition behing RL is very simple. It can be explained as follow.
1. Initialise a software agent (Presumably a neural network)
2. Make agent interact with the environment (Make an action)
3. Collect the reward and the new state of the environment (scores of a game and frame of the game after we take the action)
4. Improve the agent to get better rewards over time
The whole subfield of reinforcement learning build up upone the afore mentioned concepts and the rest of the theory build up on that basis

## Types of Reinforcement Learning
1. Value Iteration Methods
2. Policy Iteration Methods
