# REINFORCE Algorithm (Monte-Carlo policy gradient)

Monte-Carlo policy gradients proposed in [Policy Gradient Methods for
Reinforcement Learning with Function
Approximation,](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1713-policy-gradient-methods-for-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation.pdf) uses several sample rollouts to collect and update policy parameters over time to obtain the optimal policy to maximize expected rewards.
